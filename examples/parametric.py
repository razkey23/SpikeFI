# An example to demonstrate a study of the parametric neuron faults for     #
# various neuron parameters used by the SRM neurons.                        #
#                                                                           #
# In the beginning, the configuration parameters are specified to describe  #
# the FI campaigns to be carried out. Namely, the 'layers' parameter sets   #
# the layer(s) to target; 'params' selects the SRM neuron parameter(s) to   #
# vary their value; and 'percent' defines the percentage of the faulty      #
# value(s) relatively to the nominal one, which is indicated by the         #
# network's yaml configuration file (e.g., demo -> config -> nmnist.yaml).  #
# Next, the demo environment is prepared for the FI experiments, the        #
# subject network is loaded, and a dataloader for the testing set is        #
# created. Continuing with the main part of the example, a nested for-loop  #
# iterates over all the combinations of the configuration parameters, where #
# the corresponding FI campaigns are set up and executed. Each FI campaign  #
# targets each of the neuron of the selected layer(s) individually, or in   #
# other words, creates a separate fault round for each faulty location. In  #
# addition, a sampling of maximum 250^2 neuron positions are to be injected #
# in the case of very large layers, so that the experiment time is reduced. #
# Those neuron locations are picked up randomly, while in the case that the #
# targeted layer is composed of less neurons, all of them will be subject   #
# of the FI experiments. After an FI campaign is over, the results are      #
# stored in a file and the example continues with the next one. When all    #
# the FI campaigns regarding the same SRM parameter finish, the results are #
# visualized collectively for these experiments using a comparative plot of #
# classification accuracy vs. parameter's deviation.                        #
