# A simple example to demonstrate the basic usage of SpikeFI's features.    #
#                                                                           #
# After loading a trained network (see 'train_golden' example), a campaign  #
# object is initiated. First, three faults are defined, namely fx, fy,      #
# and fz, which are injected in two fault rounds to form various scenarios  #
# of FI experiments. The classification accuracy of the faulty networks     #
# is reported for each experiment and the results are stored in a file.     #
# Continuing, the campaign object is reset and a new FI campaign is         #
# initiated to perform the complete assessment of the network's output      #
# layer by injected one bit-flipped synapse fault at the MSB of every       #
# synaptic weight of the layer. Then, the FI experiment targets each        #
# synapse individually, meaning that only one synapse is faulty at a        #
# time. Finally, results are plotted in a heat map and stored in a file.    #
# This example is the implementation of the pseudo-code presented in the    #
# SpikeFI scientific publication.                                           #
